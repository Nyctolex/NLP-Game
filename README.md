# NLP-Game
Lets play Codenames vs the computer using KNN, NLP and word to vec.
The idea of the game is splitting into two teams, where each group have to make the computer guess their secret words. 
To use this code you could either use docker by
```
Docker build - t container-name:latest
Docker run container-name:latest
```
or directly run it using python:
Linux\MacOs:
```
python -m venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python application.py
```

Windows:
```
python -m venv
./venv/bin/activate.bat
pip install -r requirements.txt
python application.py
```
